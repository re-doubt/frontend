## ðŸ”§ Setting up Local Development

Required:

-   [Node v16](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/)
-   [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Make sure that:

-   Contracts are built and deployed to a live localhost network (`contracts/yarn chain`)
-   Artifacts and .env are synced (`home/sync.sh`)
-   Backend is running

Install the deps and start a dev server:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:3006`!
Open the source code and start editing!
Make sure your Metamask chainId is 31337. It is 1337 by default.

## Architecture/Layout

The app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

The files/folder structure are a **WIP** and may contain some unused files. The project is rapidly evolving so please update this section if you see it is inaccurate!

./src
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/      // App logic page
